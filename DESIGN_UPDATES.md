- Square diamond shape with "M" inside (rotated 45°)
- "Field Notes" text badge next to it
- Top-left corner placement
- Border: 4px solid black

**No Navigation:**
- Main site navigation completely hidden
- Custom layout wrapper removes all main site elements
- Only shows: Blog logo (left) + Exit button (right)

**Exit Button:**
- Top-right corner
- "← Exit" text
- Returns to main site homepage
- Mono font, bordered

**Visual Identity:**
```
Main Site:          Blog/Thoughts:
- Sans-serif        - Monospace only
- Clean minimal     - Brutalist borders
- Gold accents      - Black & white
- Spatial nav       - No navigation
- MER logo          - Diamond M logo
```

**Design Elements:**
- Heavy borders (4px solid black)
- Brutalist card shadows: `shadow-[8px_8px_0px_0px_rgba(10,10,10,1)]`
- Slight rotation on cards (±0.5deg)
- Grayscale images that become color on hover
- Large mono typography
- White background with high contrast

## 5. Sanity Authentication Fix ✅

**Issue:** Token from different project causing "Session does not match project host" error

**Solution:**
- Removed hardcoded token requirement
- Made client work with public data (useCdn: true)
- Added perspective: 'published'
- Server now runs without authentication errors

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/sanity/client.ts`

4. **Add Blog Content**

## Performance Impact

## Design Philosophy

- High contrast for readability
- Animations guide the eye
- Space for showcase video
- Clear hierarchy

**Blog/Thoughts:**
- Brutalist, raw, authentic
- Monospace typography only
- Heavy borders, stark contrast
- Feels like field notes/journal
- Separate identity from portfolio
