## CAPABILITIES PAGE

### Process Steps

**1. Understand**
```
Deep research. User immersion. Stakeholder interviews. I don't start designing until I truly understand the problem. Not the symptom—the root cause.
```

**2. Explore**
```
Rapid iteration. Divergent thinking. No attachment to first ideas. I sketch, prototype, test, and throw away. The best solution rarely shows up first.
```

**3. Build**
```
3D modeling. High-fidelity prototypes. User testing. Pixel-perfect execution. I don't just design it—I make it real enough to test with real people.
```

**4. Scale**
```
Systems thinking. Documentation. Team enablement. A good design should work without me. I build systems that teams can run with.
```

### Who I Work With
- Startups: 0→1 product design, brand identity, go-to-market strategy
- NGOs & Gov: Civic tech, social impact design, public communication
- Established Brands: Product innovation, design system evolution, UX audit
- Political Campaigns: Visual identity, digital strategy, voter engagement tools
- Tech Companies: Product design, UX/UI, design-dev collaboration
- Entrepreneurs: MVP design, pitch decks, early-stage product validation

### Tools
Figma, Rhino 3D, Adobe Creative Suite, Blender, Webflow, Framer, Miro, Notion, Python (basics), HTML/CSS, V-Ray, KeyShot

### Not Interested In
- Projects where design is just "make it pretty"
- Work that doesn't consider real users
- Rushed timelines that sacrifice quality
- Clients who want a designer, not a partner
- Problems that don't actually need solving
