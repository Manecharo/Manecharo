## üîß Sanity Setup Required

You're seeing these errors because your Sanity project needs to be configured:

### Error 1: Dataset not found
```
Dataset "production" not found for project ID "manecharo"
```

### Error 2: CORS (if you see it)
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is missing
```

---

## üìã Complete Sanity Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create Production Dataset

1. Go to: https://www.sanity.io/manage
2. Click on your **"manecharo"** project
3. In the left sidebar, click **"Datasets"**
4. Click **"Create new dataset"**
5. Name: `production`
6. Visibility: **Public**
7. Click **"Create"**

### Step 2: Add CORS Origins

1. Still in Sanity manage (https://www.sanity.io/manage)
2. Select **"manecharo"** project
3. In left sidebar, click **"API"**
4. Click **"CORS Origins"** tab
5. Click **"Add CORS origin"** button

**Add TWO origins:**

#### Origin 1 (Development):
```
http://localhost:3001
```
- Check ‚úì "Allow credentials"
- Click "Save"

#### Origin 2 (Backup for port 3000):
```
http://localhost:3000
```
- Check ‚úì "Allow credentials"
- Click "Save"

#### Origin 3 (Production):
```
https://manecharo.com
```
- Check ‚úì "Allow credentials"
- Click "Save"

## üéØ Why Port 3001?

Your server is running on **port 3001** because:
- Port 3000 is already in use by another process
- Next.js automatically uses 3001 as fallback

**You see this in the console:**
```
‚ö† Port 3000 is in use, trying 3001 instead.
- Local: http://localhost:3001
```

## üìù Summary

**What You Need to Do:**
1. Create "production" dataset in Sanity
2. Add CORS origins:
   - `http://localhost:3001`
   - `http://localhost:3000`
   - `https://manecharo.com`
3. (Optional) Install Sanity Studio to add content

**Current Status:**
- Site works perfectly with placeholder content
- Once you add CORS origins, you can fetch real content from Sanity

## üí° Quick Test

After adding CORS origins, refresh your browser at:
http://localhost:3001

The dataset error will persist until you create the "production" dataset, but the site will still work with placeholders.
