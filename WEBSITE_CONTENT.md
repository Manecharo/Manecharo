## ABOUT PAGE

### The Short Version

I'm a designer who doesn't stay in one lane.

Born in Colombia. Trained in Milan. Worked across 6 countries on 4 continents. I've designed doors in Poland, furniture in Italy, hydroponic systems in Colombia, metaverse spaces in Switzerland, and democracy programs in Malaysia.

I co-founded 3 startups. Led design teams. Trained 400+ artisans. Grew channels from zero. Built products people actually use.

I think in systems. I work with my hands. I believe design should solve real problems, not just look pretty.

Currently based in Kuala Lumpur. Colombian and Spanish passport. Available for projects that matter.

## CAPABILITIES PAGE

### Header Intro

**What I Do**

I design products, systems, and strategies that solve complex problems. I work best at the intersection of technology, social impact, and human needs.

### My Process

**1. Understand**  
Deep research. Stakeholder interviews. User immersion. I don't design without understanding the real problem first.

**2. Explore**  
Rapid iteration. Multiple concepts. No attachment to first ideas. The best solution comes from exploring the wrong ones first.

**3. Build**  
3D modeling. Prototyping. Testing. Refining. I don't just design—I make sure it can actually exist.

**4. Scale**  
Systems thinking. Team building. Documentation. A solution that can't scale isn't a solution.

### Who I Work With

→ Startups (0→1 product development)  
→ NGOs & civic organizations  
→ Government institutions  
→ Social enterprises  
→ Design agencies needing strategic partners  
→ Brands ready to evolve

### Tools

Adobe Creative Suite · Rhino · 3DS Max · Figma  
HTML/CSS/JS · Articulate 360 · AI prompt engineering  
Project management · Team leadership · 3D fabrication

### Not Interested In

Projects without purpose. Work that doesn't push anything forward. Clients who want designers to "make it pretty" instead of solve problems.
