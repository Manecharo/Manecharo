## üöÄ Push to GitHub (Manual Steps)

Since git operations require manual confirmation, here are the exact commands to run:

### Step 1: Initialize Git Repository

cd "D:\Trabajos\MER - Consultant\Website"
git init
```

### Step 2: Add All Files

```bash
git add .
```

### Step 3: Create Initial Commit

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Professional portfolio with typewriter animations, full-screen video, and multi-language support

Features:
- Typewriter animation system (sequential, character-by-character)
- Full-screen background video with overlay
- Multi-language support (EN/ES/IT)
- Professional mobile layout (logo left, menu right)

### Step 4: Add Remote Repository

**If repository doesn't exist yet:**

1. Go to https://github.com/Manecharo
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name: `Manecharo` (or `portfolio` or whatever you prefer)
4. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have code)
5. Click "Create repository"

**Then run:**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/Manecharo/Manecharo.git
```

**If repository already exists:**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/Manecharo/Manecharo.git
```

### Step 5: Push to GitHub

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Remote already exists"
```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/Manecharo/Manecharo.git
```

### Issue 2: "Repository not found"
- Make sure the repository exists on GitHub
- Check the URL is correct
- Verify you're logged in to GitHub

### Issue 3: "Authentication failed"
- GitHub no longer supports password authentication
- Use a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead
- Or use SSH keys

**To create a Personal Access Token:**
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scopes: `repo` (full control)
4. Copy the token (you'll only see it once!)
5. Use it as your password when pushing

### Issue 4: "Warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF"
This is normal on Windows, you can ignore it or run:
```bash
git config core.autocrlf true
```
